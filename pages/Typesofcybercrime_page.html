            <h3>What is malware?</h3>
            <p>  Malware is like a digital virus. It can sneak into your computer or device without you knowing, causing all sorts of problems. Some types, like viruses and worms, can spread from one system to another, while others, like ransomware, can lock you out of your own files until you pay up. Spyware and adware are more sneaky, quietly collecting your personal information or bombarding you with annoying ads. Overall, it's software designed to harm your device or steal your data.</p>

        <h3>What does malware do?</h3>
        <p>Malware can infect networks and devices and is designed to harm those devices, networks and/or their users in some way.

Depending on the type of malware and its goal, this harm may present itself differently to the user or endpoint. In some cases, the effect malware has is relatively mild and benign, and in others, it can be disastrous.

No matter the method, all types of malware are designed to exploit devices at the expense of the user and to the benefit of the hacker -- the person who has designed and/or deployed the malware.</p>

<h3>
                   Cyber Crime refers to the use of an electronic device (computer, laptop, etc.) for stealing someone's data or trying to harm them using a computer.
 
                    They usually target user's information and data for money.
 
                    There are so many different types of cybercrimes such as committing fraud, trafficking in child pornography and intellectual property, stealing identities, or violating privacy.</h3>
 
                    <h3>Cyber crime is a problem today because technology is advancing everyday, however security measures to protect this technology and the users of the technology is not advancing as quickly. This allows for cyber crime to occur more often</h3>
 
                    <h3>To be safe from cybercrime....Ensure Your system is Up-to-date , Use a Secure Internet Connection , Use Strong Password , Be Aware of Pop-ups and Fraudulent Emails , Manage Your Social Media 
                    Settings
 
                    Weak or outdated security measures, such as poor password management, unpatched software, or insufficient network security, create opportunities for cyber-criminals to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to systems
 
                    Use anti-virus softwares and keep it updaated. Using anti-virus or a comprehensive internet security solution like Kaspersky Premiumis a smart way to protect your system from attacks. Anti-virus software allows you to scan, detect and remove threats before they become a problem.</h3>

        <div class="info1">
            <h3>About cyberbullying</h3>
            <p>  Cyberbullying is a type of bullying in which one or more individuals use digital technologies to intentionally and repeatedly cause harm to another person. Cyberbullies use mobile phones, computers or other electronic devices to send texts, emails or instant messages; post comments on social media or in chat rooms; or in other ways use private or public forums to attack their victims.</p>
            <p> One of the reasons that cyberbullying has become so prevalent among teens is because cyberbullies can hide their identities online, operating anonymously or under an alias such as with email spoofing. The victim might never know where the bullying originated. Cyberbullies also have easy and quick access to online technologies day and night, and the reach of these technologies extends far beyond the school grounds. In addition, the cyberbullies are physically distanced from their victims, so they don't see firsthand the damage they're inflicting.

            <h3>About hacking</h3>
            <p>  Hacking is broadly defined as exploiting vulnerabilities in an organization's computer systems and networks to gain unauthorized access or control of digital assets. These activities involve identifying weaknesses in a computer system or network and further exploring and manipulating information with malicious or self-motivated intent.</p>
            <p> In many cases, hacking involves a combination of technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, creativity, and persistence—all to bypass security measures and access private information or protected databases. While some forms of “white hat” hacking can be done ethically to improve security, it's most commonly conducted as a means to steal sensitive data, compromise systems, or spread viruses and malware.</p>
